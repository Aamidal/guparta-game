# guparta-game

update: This is quickly becoming a mess of nested functions.

A basic text adventure set in the Three Sisters.

The aim is to mix simple RPG mechanics with the usual interactive fiction/choose your own adventure gameplay loop. 

The player will control a character named Pachei. The starship she serves on has docked at a remote station in the Guparta system to refuel and resupply.

This is my first attempt at coding a game. I have no illusions that it will be anything but messy, but I look forward to everything it will teach me about javascript and general program design.
