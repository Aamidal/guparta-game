    Again scene with Tavalas
        Perhaps as a good first 2d6 check. Low stakes, failure just has Tavalas repeat "Again" and allow for another check. Could continue ad nauseum. Shows failure is mostly Pachei giving up and disappointing her relationships. Possibly paralleled with Bahareh's first 2d6 check which has a pretty nasty penalty
    Opportunity to talk to guparta, choice to identify mojgan. if do, moj possibly treated with more respect and bahareh's path made more difficult as they make more concerted effort to keep apart from the start
Dickin around League Office and docks
