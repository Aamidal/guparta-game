**Structure**
perhaps alternating scenes.
8 hours until ship is refueled, perhaps split into 8 "chapters/scenes" with two parts?
    1.  docking, meeting kishor // 
    2.  shrine, wandering //
    etc
    something happens at 
Pachei's sections much easier, more linear, a little more like a walking simulator with a focus on relationships. Chances for simple Pachei choices to interfere with Bahareh (ex:  Pachei chooses to turn off comm before entering shrine, Bahareh unable to track or something). Bahareh's choices answering questions about past, affecting character disposition for those who interact with new dancers.



**Pachei**
* Relationship with and nature of Hosalira Mojgan
* Koyan perspective
Gupartans try to ruin Bahareh's reputation, esp once they realize who Mojgan is. 
Discovering stuff Bahareh has done in the past
**Bahareh**
* Kotelgan perspective
* Non-Teraati dancer perspective
- some choices given to Bahareh about tone of/history of people? 
    "You see [character]. When did you last see him?"
        1. [something positive] 2 [something neutral] 3 [something negative]
        affects some tone in convo, modifiers to things related to that character, esp if you picked one of you threatened to kill the other.
