# Tentative Game Mechanics

## Core Mechanic

- Choice based text-adventure gameplay modified by dice roll
- Each Player Character has stats and an inventory
- Items, previous choices, and stats affect the roll
- Roll is likely 2d6, Traveller/Disco Elysium style


## Game Structure

- Game is split in two halves, following Pachei and Bahareh though the events of the Crew's trip to Guparta
- Do the POVs alternate? Or is it more like Resident Evil 2, where one follows the other and retroactively contextualizes it?

- Pachei's POV emphasizes: 
    - Relationship with and nature of her Hosalira, Mojgan
    - Koyan perspective
    - ?
- Bahareh's POV emphasizes:
    - Kotelgan perspective
    - Non-Teraati dancer mindset
    - ?

- Character select? Pachei's route easier, bahareh harder?

# Application Design

## UI

- Viewport divided horizontally:
    - Research *canvas* elements
    - Illustrated Scene Above
    - Description Below
    - Choices arrange below that, modifiers and chances on hover

- Is it possible to save and resume? How is that achieved?
    - Reset progress button
    - Scene Select?
    - Passcodes lmao?
